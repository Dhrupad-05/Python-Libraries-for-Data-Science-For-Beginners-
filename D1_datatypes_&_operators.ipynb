        "This session covered several fundamental programming concepts, including the use of escape sequences like `\\n` (newline) and `\\t` (tab) for formatting output. It then revisited a problem on how to find the minimum numerical value from a set of variables by creatively using boolean logic (`True` is `1`, `False` is `0`) combined with arithmetic operations. The lecture also explained the logical `not` operator and introduced the core concepts of number systems (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal) and bitwise operations, which manipulate data at the individual bit level.\n",

The lecture moves on to **derived logical operations** like XOR, NOR, and NAND, explaining their truth tables and how they are derived from basic operations. The main focus then shifts to **control structures**, specifically **if-elif-else statements**, demonstrating their syntax and practical use in solving problems like grading a student based on their percentage.
